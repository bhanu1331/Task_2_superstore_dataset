# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes sales and profit data from a Superstore dashboard.  
The goal is to understand key performance drivers across **segments, product sub-categories, and regions**, and to prepare insights in both **PowerPoint presentation** and **documentation** form for business decision-making.

##  Key Steps
1. **Data Review** – Examined dashboard metrics including total sales, average sales, segment-wise share, sub-category profits, and regional performance.  
2. **Visualization Explanation** – Broke down each chart (KPI cards, Pie Chart, Bar Charts, Map, Filters) with insights.  
3. **PowerPoint Preparation** – Created an 8-slide presentation explaining each visualization with findings.
4. **README.md Preparation** – Documented the entire process for clarity and reusability.

##  Insights
- **Consumer segment** is the major driver of sales.  
- **Bookcases** are the most profitable sub-category.
